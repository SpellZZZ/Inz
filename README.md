# Mobile storage system

## Project
The project consists of three main components: a mobile application, a web application built with React, and a backend implemented using Spring Boot. My contribution was focused solely on the backend. I was responsible for designing and developing the backend services and APIs to support the functionality of both the mobile and web applications.

## Overview
The aim of this work is to design, implement, and test a web and mobile application that can serve as support for companies offering transportation services. These applications are intended to assist transportation companies in monitoring their transport operations.
